The generated Ecore files here are not the same as the one in org.omg.sysml:
They are the result of the "Load" action of the UMLImporter wizard.

SysML_from_tests_before_ST6RI-61.reference is a reference of the EPackage obtained by the conversion before any change was made (as with the default UML importer).
