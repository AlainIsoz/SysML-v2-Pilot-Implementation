 * <p>Classes serve to subdivide Classifiers into two kinds of objects: those that have some definition beyond their property values and those that are defined entirely by their values. Classes are the first kind. Two objects that conform to a given class can have entirely identical descriptions and properties and still be treated as separate. Classes are intended to be used to describe objects where two copies with the same properties may sit side-by-side and yet be independent of one another.</p>
