     * remarks: One octave (oct) is the logarithmic frequency range between `f_1` and `f_2` when `f_2/f_1 = 2`. Similarly, one decade (dec) is the logarithmic frequency range between `f_1` and `f_2` when `f_2/f_1 = 10`; thus `1 "@[dec]" = log_2(10) "@[oct]" ≈ 3.322 "@[oct]"`. ISO 266 specifies preferred frequencies for acoustics separated by logarithmic frequency ranges equal to one tenth of a decade (`0.1 "@[dec]"`). Each `0.1 "@[dec]"` logarithmic frequency range is referred to in ISO 266 as a "one-third-octave interval" because `0.1 "@[dec]"` is approximately equal to `1/3 "@[oct]"`. Similarly, a logarithmic frequency range of `0.3 "@[dec]"` is referred to as a "one-octave interval" because `0.3 "@[dec]"` is approximately equal to `1 "@[oct]"`. A logarithmic frequency range equal to one tenth of a decade can be referred to as a decidecade.
